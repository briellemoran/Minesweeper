Assignment 9: MINESWEEPER

Extra Implementations:
1) Displays a "Mines remaining:" text that shows how many mines are left to be uncovered, so
   a "flagged" mine will make the count go down
2) Displays a "Clicks" count displaying how many clicks the player has used
   (flagging a mine doesn't count as a click)
3) When the game is over, the player can click "R" to restart the game
